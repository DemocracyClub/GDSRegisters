# GDS Registers in Git

This project mirrors the registers found at https://www.registers.service.gov.uk/ and commits them in a git repo.

This is because:

1. GitHub provides a nice interface for viewing the data
2. It's nice to see a diff of what changed over time
3. No need to click though an email capture form
